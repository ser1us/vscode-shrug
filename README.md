# ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

This extension will add a snippet to insert an ascii shrug at the current cursor position. Or, right after the selected text.

Sometimes there are simply no words to describe a situation. And that is when this extension comes in handy :)

## Features

Use the command palette or the default shortcut (Ctrl+U Ctrl+U) to insert a shrug at your current cursor position. If you like you can also mark text and then insert the shrug right next to it.
