# ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

This extension will add a snippet to insert an ascii shrug at the current cursor position. Or, right after the selected text. 

Sometimes there are simply no words for the current code and that is when this extension comes in handy :)


## Features

Use the command palette or the default shortcut (Ctrl+U Ctrl+U) to insert a shrug at your current cursor position. If you like you can also mark text and then insert the shrug right next to it.
